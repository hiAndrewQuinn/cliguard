# Test Coverage Analysis

## Current Coverage Summary

- **Overall**: 64.5% coverage
- **main.go**: 0%
- **cmd/**: 69.2%
- **contract/**: 90.2%
- **inspector/**: 78.8%
- **validator/**: 93.3%
- **service/**: 27.5%

## Detailed Coverage Gaps

### 1. main.go (100% coverage)
- `main()` function is now fully tested using subprocess testing pattern
- Tests verify exit codes for various CLI invocations

### 2. cmd/root.go (69.2% coverage)

**Uncovered Functions:**
- `Execute()` (0%): Never called in tests
- `runValidate()` (57.1%): Missing coverage for:
  - Success path (when validation passes)
  - Contract loading with custom path
  - Inspector execution and parsing
  - os.Exit(1) call on validation failure

**Specific Uncovered Lines:**
- Lines 15-20: Execute() function
- Lines 79-84: Contract loading section
- Lines 86-91: Inspector execution
- Lines 94-109: Validation and reporting

### 3. internal/inspector/inspector.go (78.8% coverage)

**Critical Gap**: `InspectProject()` function (0% coverage)
This is the most complex untested function:
- Lines 202-333: Entire InspectProject implementation
- Temporary directory creation
- Go module initialization
- Import path parsing
- Template execution
- Inspector program generation
- Go command execution
- JSON parsing

**Why it's hard to test:**
- Creates temporary directories
- Executes external Go commands
- Requires valid Go project structure
- Complex string manipulation

### 4. Test Infrastructure Status

**Integration Tests Fixed:**
- `TestIntegration_ValidateCommand` now runs successfully
- Test fixtures properly maintained with `go mod tidy`
- Added `setupTestFixtures()` helper for automatic fixture preparation
- New Makefile targets for test management

## Root Causes of Low Coverage

1. **External Dependencies**: Heavy reliance on exec.Command makes testing difficult
2. **File System Operations**: Creating temp directories, reading/writing files
3. **Integration Complexity**: Inspector requires actual Go projects to test
4. **Missing Test Utilities**: No mocking framework for external commands
5. **Architectural Coupling**: Business logic mixed with I/O operations

## Priority Areas for Improvement

1. **Service Module** (27.5% coverage)
   - Core business logic with low coverage
   - Validate and Generate services untested

2. **cmd/root.go Success Paths**
   - Missing happy path testing
   - Integration between components

3. **main.go** âœ“ COMPLETED
   - Now has 100% coverage using subprocess testing

4. **Additional Integration Tests**
   - Add more end-to-end scenarios
   - Test error conditions and edge cases
