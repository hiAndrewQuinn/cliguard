# Cliguard Testing Summary

## Test Suite Created

I've created a comprehensive test suite for cliguard that covers various aspects of Cobra CLI validation:

### ✅ Successful Tests

1. **Simple CLI** (`basic/simple-cli/`)
   - Minimal CLI with just a root command
   - Tests basic contract generation and validation
   - **Result**: Both generation and validation work correctly

2. **Subcommands CLI** (`basic/subcommands/`)
   - CLI with nested subcommands, flags, and aliases
   - Tests complex command structures with persistent flags
   - **Result**: Successfully captures and validates nested structures

3. **Breaking Changes Detection** (`validation/breaking/`)
   - v1 and v2 CLIs with intentional breaking changes
   - Tests ability to detect removed commands, changed flags, renamed options
   - **Result**: Correctly detects all breaking changes including:
     - Missing flags and commands
     - Renamed flags and commands
     - Changed flag types
     - Modified descriptions

### 🐛 Issues Discovered

1. **Complex Flag Types** (`edge-cases/flag-types/`)
   - **Issue**: Cliguard generates invalid type names for complex flag types
   - **Details**: Types like `map[string]string` are output as `*pflag.stringToStringValue`
   - **Impact**: Generated contracts fail validation for CLIs using advanced flag types
   - **Recommendation**: Normalize complex types to simpler representations

```

### 🛠️ Test Automation

Created `run-tests.sh` script that:
- Automatically runs all test cases
- Tests both generation and validation
- Detects expected failures (like breaking changes)
- Provides colored output and summary statistics

### 📋 Key Findings

1. **Core Functionality Works**: Basic contract generation and validation work well for standard Cobra CLIs
2. **Breaking Change Detection**: Excellent at detecting incompatible changes
3. **Type System Needs Work**: Complex flag types need better handling
4. **Network Dependencies**: Testing was hampered by network issues preventing Go module downloads

### 🚀 Recommendations

1. **Fix Type Normalization**: Convert pflag internal types to standard types in contracts
2. **Add More Edge Cases**: Test deeply nested commands, dynamic command registration
3. **Performance Testing**: Add tests for CLIs with hundreds of commands
4. **Documentation**: Create best practices guide for making CLIs cliguard-compatible
5. **Better Error Messages**: Improve error reporting for complex scenarios

## Next Steps

The test suite provides a solid foundation for:
- Regression testing as cliguard evolves
- Identifying edge cases that need handling
- Demonstrating cliguard's capabilities
- Validating fixes for discovered issues
